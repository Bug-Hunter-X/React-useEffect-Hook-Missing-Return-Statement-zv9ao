# React useEffect Hook Missing Return Statement

This repository demonstrates a common error in React applications: forgetting to include a return statement in a `useEffect` hook.  This can lead to memory leaks and unexpected behavior if not handled correctly.

## The Bug

The `bug.js` file shows a component with a `useEffect` hook that's missing a return statement.  This means that any cleanup functions (e.g., event listeners, timers) defined inside the `useEffect` won't be executed when the component unmounts.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version of the component.  The `return` statement within the `useEffect` hook ensures that any cleanup functions are properly executed when the component unmounts, preventing potential memory leaks and unexpected behavior.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Observe the console output and the behavior of the component.
